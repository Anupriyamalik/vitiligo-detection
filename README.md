**Vitiligo Detection: Utilizing Deep Learning for Skin Condition Analysis**
    This project aims to develop a vitiligo detection system using deep learning techniques. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the system analyzes real-time camera feed or video input to identify vitiligo-affected regions on the skin. The project includes preprocessing steps, a trained deep learning model for vitiligo detection, and visual indicators to highlight the identified regions.
**Features:**
            Real-time vitiligo detection using a webcam or video feed.
            Preprocessing of frames, including resizing and normalization.
            Utilization of a pre-trained deep learning model for vitiligo detection.
            Visual indicators (bounding boxes, masks) to highlight vitiligo-affected regions.
            Non-invasive and accessible solution for early detection and monitoring of vitiligo.
            Potential for integration with healthcare applications and remote consultations.
